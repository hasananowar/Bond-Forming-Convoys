This repository provides the source code for the implementation of a prototype system described in: 

# Detecting and Visualizing Bond-Forming Convoys in Atomic and Molecular Trajectories (Demo Paper) (NOTE: Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024).

The implementation is a result of a two-semester long Senior Design project of a team of seniors at Iowa State University (Software Engineering and Computer Engineering majors).

A detailed report discussing:

- Functional/non-functional requirements and constraints
- Technology consideration
- Design Choices and Analysis
- Architecture
- Testing (unit, interface, integration, system, regression, acceptance)

is publicly available at: https://sdmay24-19.sd.ece.iastate.edu/DesignDocuments/CPRE_492_Final_Report.pdf

The document also contains an Operation Manual.

> Presently, we only provide a small sample of the dataset used. Since the data was obtained from our collaborators working on Molecular Dynamics Simulation from other Universities - please send us a formal request via email (mhanowar@iastate.edu) and we will promptly respond and provide it.
