# Detecting and Visualizing Bond-Forming Convoys in Atomic and Molecular Trajectories

This repository provides the source code for the implementation of a prototype system described in: **Detecting and Visualizing Bond-Forming Convoys in Atomic and Molecular Trajectories (Demo Paper)**(NOTE: Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024).

The implementation is a result of a two-semester long Senior Design project of a team of seniors at Iowa State University (Software Engineering and Computer Engineering Majors).

## How to Use:

A detailed report discussing:

- Functional/non-functional requirements and constraints
- Technology consideration
- Design Choices and Analysis
- Architecture
- Testing (unit, interface, integration, system, regression, acceptance)

is publicly available at: https://sdmay24-19.sd.ece.iastate.edu/DesignDocuments/CPRE_492_Final_Report.pdf. The document also contains an Operation Manual.

We provide instructions for how to use the app in this [video](Demo.mp4). An extended version for the demonstration video can be found [here](https://iowastate-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mhanowar_iastate_edu/EWPRfOWgxJBLktCQojAjmZgBF46prBUjvEeFvQKjnRWSYw?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=HGAY4r).

## Datasets

Presently, we only provide a small sample of the dataset used. Since the data was obtained from our collaborators working on Molecular Dynamics Simulation from other Universities - please send us a formal request via email and we will promptly respond and provide it.
